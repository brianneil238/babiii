# 📸 Photo Album Setup Guide

Your birthday surprise now includes a beautiful, romantic photo album for your birthday girl! Here's how to add your special photos.

## 🖼️ How to Add Your Photos

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP (JPG recommended for best compatibility)
- **Size**: Aim for landscape or portrait images around 800x600 to 1200x800 pixels
- **Quantity**: You can add up to 10-12 photos for the best experience
- **Content**: Choose romantic photos - dates, trips, special moments together, beautiful portraits

### Step 2: Add Images to the Project
1. Place your images in the `web/public/` folder
2. Name them descriptively (e.g., `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, `photo3.jpg`)

### Step 3: Update the Photo Album Component
Open `web/src/PhotoAlbum.tsx` and replace the sample photos with your own:

```typescript
const photos: Photo[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    src: '/photo1.jpg', // Replace with your photo path
    alt: 'Beautiful Birthday Girl',
    caption: 'My beautiful birthday girl ❤️',
    date: 'Forever & Always'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    src: '/photo2.jpg', // Replace with your photo path
    alt: 'Special Moment Together',
    caption: 'Every moment with you is magical ✨',
    date: 'Our Love Story'
  },
  // Add more photos with your images...
];
```

## 🎨 Customization Options
